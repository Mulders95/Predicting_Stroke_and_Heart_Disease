## Business Case Question
Regression: What relevant predictors predict the occurence of stroke, hypertension and heart disease?

## Buisness Case

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify the key predictors that contribute to the occurrence of stroke, hypertension, and heart disease by leveraging data science techniques, particularly data visualization and machine learning models. Using this knowledge, our goal is to develop a predictive model that can predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke, hyper tension and heart disease based on the input parameters like gender, age, avg_glucose_level, bmi, ever_married, smoking status etc., which could assist healthcare providers in identifying individuals at high risk and implementing preventive measures effectively.

### Requirements

This project uses the following Python libraries:

*Insert Libraries*

## Data Overview
Example....
Description of dataset (number of records, features).
Explanation of key variables (stroke, hypertension, heart disease, and predictors).
Handling missing values and categorical data transformation.

## Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values


## Exploratory Data Analysis



## Key Findings & Predictive Power of Features
For Stroke Prediction: Top influencing factors (e.g., age, hypertension, heart disease).
For Hypertension Prediction: Impact of bmi, smoking, and work type.
For Heart Disease Prediction: Role of age, hypertension, and glucose levels.

## Discussion & Interpretation
Insights on which groups are most at risk.
Potential bias or limitations in data.
